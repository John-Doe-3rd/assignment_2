html entities are characters that are reserved in html mostly symbols and unique characters like the following examples 

< name is &it; and number &#60;
> name is &gt; and number &#62;
" name is &quot; and number &#34; etc etc

they are important since they allow you to print letters that you would usually have a hard time printing in html
